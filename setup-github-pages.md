# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## The Issue
The error `Get Pages site failed. Please verify that the repository has Pages enabled` occurs when GitHub Pages is not properly configured in the repository settings.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (in the left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

### 2. Verify Workflow Permissions
Ensure your repository has the correct permissions:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, select **Read and write permissions**
3. Check **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
4. Click **Save**

### 3. Manual Pages Configuration (Alternative)
If the automatic enablement doesn't work, you can manually configure:

```yaml
- name: Setup Pages
  uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
  with:
    enablement: true
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### 4. Repository Requirements
Ensure your repository meets these requirements:
- Repository must be public (or have GitHub Pro/Team/Enterprise)
- Repository must have content in the main/master branch
- The workflow file must be in `.github/workflows/` directory

### 5. Environment Configuration
The workflow now includes:
- Proper permissions for Pages deployment
- `enablement: true` parameter to auto-configure Pages
- Correct artifact upload and deployment steps

### 6. Verification
After setup, verify by:
1. Pushing changes to trigger the workflow
2. Checking **Actions** tab for workflow execution
3. Visiting **Settings** → **Pages** to see the deployment URL

## Troubleshooting

### If Pages is still not enabled:
1. Try manually enabling Pages in repository settings first
2. Then run the workflow
3. Check that your repository is public or has appropriate plan

### If deployment fails:
1. Verify the build artifacts are created correctly
2. Check that the `frontend/build` directory exists
3. Ensure all dependencies install successfully

### Common Fixes:
- Make repository public
- Enable Pages manually before running workflow
- Check workflow permissions in repository settings
- Verify the main branch is set correctly

## Updated Workflow Features
- ✅ Automatic Pages enablement
- ✅ Proper permissions configuration
- ✅ Build artifact upload
- ✅ Deployment to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Status notifications
