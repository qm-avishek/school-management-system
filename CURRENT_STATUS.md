## ⚠️ PENDING: Database Connection (5% Remaining)

### 🔍 Issue Identified
- MongoDB Atlas connection failing with DNS resolution error
- Error: `querySrv EREFUSED _mongodb._tcp.cluster0.b4et8vg.mongodb.net`
- This is a network/DNS connectivity issue, not a code problem

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Created
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide: `MONGODB_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Connection test script: `backend/scripts/testConnection.js`
- Multiple solution approaches provided

### 📋 Once Database Connects
When the MongoDB Atlas connection is resolved:
1. Run `node scripts/seedAdmin.js` to create admin user
2. Login with: admin@ssgbcollege.edu / Admin@123
3. Full CRUD functionality will be available
