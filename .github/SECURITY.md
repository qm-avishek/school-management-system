## ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 3 business days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-3 days
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks
  - Low: Next planned release

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication**
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt
- **Session management**
- **Password complexity requirements**

### Data Protection
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **SQL injection prevention**
- **XSS protection**
- **CSRF protection**
- **Data encryption** in transit (HTTPS)
- **Environment variable** protection

### Infrastructure Security
- **Regular dependency updates**
- **Security headers** implementation
- **Rate limiting**
- **CORS configuration**
- **Error handling** (no sensitive data exposure)

## 🔧 Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
4. **Implement proper error handling**
5. **Regular dependency audits**: `npm audit`
6. **Follow OWASP guidelines**
7. **Use HTTPS** in production

### For Administrators
1. **Regular security updates**
2. **Strong password policies**
3. **Regular backups**
4. **Monitor access logs**
5. **Principle of least privilege**
6. **Regular security assessments**

## 🚫 Security Anti-Patterns

**Don't:**
- Store passwords in plain text
- Use weak JWT secrets
- Expose sensitive data in error messages
- Skip input validation
- Use outdated dependencies
- Commit API keys or secrets
- Allow unrestricted file uploads
