# GitHub Actions Workflow Updates - Complete ✅

## Overview
Updated GitHub Actions workflows to fix deployment issues and remove redundancy.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Redundant CI-CD Workflow ❌
- **Removed**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- **Reason**: Redundant with separate frontend and backend workflows
- **Impact**: Eliminates duplicate builds and conflicting deployments

### 2. Fixed Frontend Workflow ✅
- **File**: `.github/workflows/frontend-vercel.yml`
- **Updates**:
  - ✅ Fixed production API URL to use actual Railway backend
  - ✅ Added environment variables to Vercel deployment
  - ✅ Corrected YAML formatting issues
  - ✅ Ensured proper secret references

### 3. Fixed Backend Workflow ✅
- **File**: `.github/workflows/backend-railway.yml`
- **Updates**:
  - ✅ Recreated with proper YAML structure
  - ✅ Fixed Railway deployment configuration
  - ✅ Added proper service deployment steps
  - ✅ Ensured correct secret references

### 4. Updated Production Environment ✅
- **File**: `frontend/.env.production`
- **Update**: Changed API URL to actual Railway backend:
  ```
  REACT_APP_API_URL=https://school-management-system-production-a207.up.railway.app/api
  ```

## Required GitHub Secrets ✅

### For Vercel (Frontend Deployment)
```
VERCEL_TOKEN - ✅ Set
VERCEL_ORG_ID - ✅ Set
VERCEL_FRONTEND_PROJECT_ID - ✅ Set (was VERCEL_PROJECT_ID)
```

### For Railway (Backend Deployment)
```
RAILWAY_TOKEN - ✅ Set
RAILWAY_BACKEND_SERVICE_ID - ✅ Set
```

## Workflow Triggers

### Frontend Workflow
- **Triggers**: Changes to `frontend/**` OR workflow file changes
- **Actions**: Test (on PR) → Deploy to Vercel (on main push)
- **Environment**: Uses production Railway API URL

### Backend Workflow  
- **Triggers**: Changes to `backend/**` OR workflow file changes
- **Actions**: Test (on PR) → Deploy to Railway (on main push)
- **Health Check**: Validates `/api/health` endpoint

## Expected Results

### ✅ Frontend Deployment
- Should now deploy successfully to Vercel
- Will use correct Railway API URL in production
- Environment variables properly configured

### ✅ Backend Deployment
- Should now deploy successfully to Railway
- Proper service configuration applied
- Health checks will validate against correct endpoint

## Next Steps

1. **Test Deployment**: Make a test commit to trigger workflows
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check GitHub Actions for successful completion
3. **Verify Connectivity**: Ensure frontend can communicate with Railway backend
4. **Update URLs**: Update any remaining documentation with production URLs

**Status**: ✅ **WORKFLOWS FIXED AND READY**  
**Next Action**: Test deployment with a commit to main branch
