## ✅ RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID (Found!)
```
RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID = 30054b20-2a24-4142-a281-724c52eabc34
```

## 🔑 RAILWAY_TOKEN (Need to Generate)

### Step 1: Get Railway Token
1. Go to: https://railway.app/account/tokens
2. Click "Create New Token"
3. Name: "GitHub-Actions-Deploy"
4. Copy the generated token (starts with rlwy_...)

### Step 2: Add to GitHub Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/qm-avishek/school-management-system/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add these two secrets:

**Secret 1:**
- Name: `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID`
- Value: `30054b20-2a24-4142-a281-724c52eabc34`

**Secret 2:**
- Name: `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
- Value: `[Your generated token from Railway]`

### Step 3: Test Automatic Deployment
After adding both secrets, any push to main branch will automatically deploy!

## � Fixed Issues:

### ✅ Created New Workflow:
- **File**: `.github/workflows/railway-simple.yml`
- **Focus**: Railway deployment only (no Vercel dependencies)
- **Simpler**: Tests → Deploy → Status
- **Robust**: Uses Railway CLI directly

### ❌ Previous Issues Fixed:
1. **Missing Railway Secrets** → Need to add to GitHub
2. **Complex Dependencies** → Simplified workflow
3. **Vercel Failures** → Removed Vercel dependency
4. **YAML Syntax Errors** → Clean new workflow

## �📋 Quick Copy-Paste:

**For GitHub Secrets:**
```
Name: RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID
Value: 30054b20-2a24-4142-a281-724c52eabc34

Name: RAILWAY_TOKEN  
Value: [Get from https://railway.app/account/tokens]
```

## 🚀 Current Status:
- ✅ Railway Service ID: Found
- ⏳ Railway Token: Need to generate
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow: Fixed and simplified
- ✅ Railway deployment: Working manually
- 🔄 Auto deployment: Will work after adding secrets
