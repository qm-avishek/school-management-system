# Library.js Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Function Scope Issues
- **Problem**: `fetchBooks`, `fetchStats`, and `fetchBorrowRecords` were defined inside `useEffect` but called outside their scope
- **Solution**: Moved all fetch functions outside `useEffect` and renamed them for clarity:
  - `fetchBooks` → `fetchBooksData`
  - `fetchStats` → `fetchStatsData` 
  - `fetchBorrowRecords` → `fetchBorrowRecordsData`
- **Result**: Functions are now properly accessible throughout the component

### 2. ESLint Nested Ternary Warnings
- **Problem**: ESLint treating warnings as errors due to nested ternary operations
- **Solution**: Replaced nested ternary operations with IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) patterns:
  - Status display for borrow records
  - Modal title generation
- **Result**: Code is more readable and ESLint compliant

### 3. Code Structure Improvements
- **Simplified refresh functions**: Now call the main fetch functions instead of duplicating logic
- **Better error handling**: Maintained existing error handling patterns
- **Cleaner code**: Reduced duplication and improved maintainability

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/Library.js` - Complete refactor and ESLint fixes

## Testing Status
- ✅ No ESLint errors in Library.js
- ✅ Functions properly scoped and accessible
- ✅ Code follows React best practices
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed

## Next Steps
1. Monitor GitHub Actions pipeline for successful build
2. Verify frontend build completes without errors
3. Test library functionality in browser once deployed

## Build Process Improvements
With these fixes, the CI/CD pipeline should now:
- ✅ Pass MongoDB connection tests
- ✅ Pass backend tests
- ✅ Pass frontend linting
- ✅ Complete frontend build successfully
- ✅ Deploy without errors
